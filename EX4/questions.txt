0.  BMP:  Over 4 billion or 32 bits
    JPEG: 16,777,216 or 24 bits
    GIF:  internal reference pallette of 256 from the 16,777,216 supported 
         or 8bits referencing from a 24 bit pallette.

2.  Lossy compression is when the original data of the file can't be recovered completely
    Lossless compression is when the original data of the file can be recovered completely.

4.  1.- The first character on the filename is changed on the directory entry
        which is in a linked list of file and directory entries.
    2.- The 512 bit FAT clusters corresponding to the file data are moved to the drive's list
        of free clusters.
5.  1.- A slack space sanitizer can be used to ovverwrite blocks that contained 
        temporary and deleted, retained data blocks, and vendor-hidden data
        reading data from overwritten files is said to beakin to UFO experiences and, 
        since there is usable data that overrides the deleted clusters, these sanitizers
        don't bother.
6.  It defines standard integer types with determined different lengths
7.  The lengths for the int types is standard and also the types contain
    specific macros to apply them.
8.  The number of bytes for the types are:
    BYTE: 8 bits.
    DWORD: 32 bits.
    LONG: 32 bits.
    WORD: 16 bits.
9.  The first two characters in a bitmap must be BM 0x4D42
10. bfSize is the size of the file, biSize is the size of the BiTMAPINFOHEADER and is constant
11. If biHeight it's negative, the bitmap is read from the top down from the upper left corner
    if it's positive it's read from the upper left corner
12. The field that specifies the depth of color is biBitCount
13. The file doesn't exist or is inaccesible
14. Because the nmemb argument is the number of pieces of code of the size of second argument size
    wer're always writing a single piece of code of that size
15. three because we have three RGBTRIPLES size three and we need to begin in a pointer starting with four
    so we need three bytes to go from 9 to 12.
16. fseek looks for a position in the buffer which is the first argument FILE. the second argument is the offset
    and can be positive to go forward or negative to go backwards the third argument is weather we start from the
    current position in the file, the begining or the end
17. SEEK_CUR looks for the current position when readin ga file.
