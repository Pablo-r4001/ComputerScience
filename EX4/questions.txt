2.  Lossy compression is when the original data of the file can't be recovered completely

4.  1.- The first character on the filename is changed on the directory entry
        which is in a linked list of file and directory entries.
    2.- The 512 bit FAT clusters corresponding to the file data are moved to the drive's list
        of free clusters.
5.  1.- A slack space sanitizer can be used to ovverwrite blocks that contained 
        temporary and deleted, retained data blocks, and vendor-hidden data
        reading data from overwritten files is said to beakin to UFO experiences and, 
        since there is usable data that overrides the deleted clusters, these sanitizers
        don't bother.
6.  It defines standard integer types with determined different lengths
7.  The lengths for the int types is standard and also the types contain
    specific macros to apply them.
8.  The number of bytes for the types are:
    BYTE: 8 bits.
    DWORD: 32 bits.
    LONG: 32 bits.
    WORD: 16 bits.
9.  The first two characters in a bitmap must be BM 0x4D42
